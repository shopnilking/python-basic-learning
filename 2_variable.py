# declaring variables

# x = 5
# y = "John"
# print(x)
# print(y)

# overriding variables
# x = 4       # x is of type int
# x = "Sally" # x is now of type str
# x = "Sagar" # x is now of type str
# print(x)

# type casting
# x = str(3)    # x will be '3'
# y = int(3)    # y will be 3
# z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0
# print(5*x)

# getting variables type
# print(type(x))
# print(type(y))
# print(type(z))

# variable names are type sensative 
# a = 4
# A = "Sally"
# #A will not overwrite a
# print(a)
# print(A)
