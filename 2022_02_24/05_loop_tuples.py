# Python - Loop Tuples
# Loop Through a Tuple
# You can loop through the tuple items by using a for loop.

# thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
# for x in thistuple:
#   print(x)
  
# Learn more about for loops in our Python For Loops Chapter.

# Loop Through the Index Numbers
# You can also loop through the tuple items by referring to their index number.
# Use the range() and len() functions to create a suitable iterable.

# thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
# print(len(thistuple))
# for i in range(len(thistuple)):
#     print(i)
# for i in range(len(thistuple)):
#   print(thistuple[i])
